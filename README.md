Convict expands on the standard pattern of configuring node.js applications in a
way that is more robust and accessible to collaborators, who may have less
interest in digging through code in order to inspect or modify settings. By
introducing a configuration schema, convict gives project collaborators more
**context** on each setting and enables **validation and early failures** for
when configuration goes wrong.
